            <h2>World and National Problematics</h2>
            <p>In France, more than 10 million tons of food are wasted each year, resulting in 16 billion euros of waste. Students often struggle to afford food, leading to increased food waste and reliance on charities, which have seen a 150% rise in demand.</p>
            <p>Globally, food waste contributes to a 3.3 billion ton carbon footprint, highlighting the need for collective action to reduce waste and promote sustainability.</p>
